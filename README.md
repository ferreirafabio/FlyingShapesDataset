# Description
The dataset consists of 90 000 videos that show two objects of equal shape and size in which one object approaches the other one. The object speed during the process of approaching is hereby modelled by a proportional-derivative controller. Overall, three different shapes (Rectangle, Triangle and Circle) are provided. Initial conÔ¨Åguration of the objects such as position and color were randomly sampled.

For instance, one can use this dataset as a toy dataset to test the capability and behaviour of a deep neural network before address real-world data as we have done with a deep auto-encoder:
